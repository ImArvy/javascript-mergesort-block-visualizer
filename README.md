# javascript-mergesort-block-visualizer
I am learning how to use Javascript(and React), CSS and HTML as I was inspired to create more hands on and interactive projects. Using React to generate an application I plan to take what I have learned through my Computer Science courses, where I have used C++ and Python, and create a visualizer for breaking down an array, or list, and then sorting it using the merge sort algorithm. I aim to display every step such as each new sub array created from the algorithm in a way that is very similar to what would be done on paper while learning thow the algorithm works. This could potentially serve as a learning tool for people like me who tend to work better with visual information but I primarily intend to use this project to show my understanding of the merge sort algorithm, as a fu
ture reference if I need help remembering this sort algorithm, and to have fun learning more about the inner workings of the merge sort. After the completion of this inital project I plan to add more sorting algorithms to this visualizer.
